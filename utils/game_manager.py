# utils/game_manager.py - Game logic manager with server-side coordination
# FIXED VERSION: Single source of truth for game state management
# FIX: Removed duplicate payment in process_winner method
# FIXED: Commission calculation based on actual player count, not prize pool
# FIXED: 4 corners pattern verification now checked first
# ADDED: Detailed logging for bingo verification debugging
# CRITICAL FIX: Prevent multiple concurrent card_purchase games and ensure refunds
# ULTRA-FAST BINGO VERIFICATION: Optimized for lightning-fast claims
# FIXED: Added stuck game recovery for active phase
# FIXED: Handle AttributeError from number_caller.is_calling_numbers_for_game
# ADDED: record_game_commission method for commission tracking
# CRITICAL FIX: 10-second winner display with proper announcement and countdown
# FIXED: Winner display countdown stuck at 5 seconds issue
# INTEGRATION: Added FakeUserManager integration for simulated players
# NUMBER CALLING: Reduced from 5 seconds to 4 seconds
# TWO WINNER SUPPORT: Added support for 2 winners with 50-50 prize split
# ==================== NEW FAKE PLAYER LOGIC ====================
# RANDOM FAKE PLAYERS: Random number between 60-70 per game (decided at game creation)
# FAKE PLAYERS FROZEN: No dynamic adjustments during countdown
# EARLY BROADCAST: Fake players visible at 6-7 seconds
# REAL PLAYERS ADD: Real players join without affecting fake count
# ==================== CRITICAL FIX: MULTIPLE WINNERS SENT AT ONCE ====================
# When game ends (max winners reached), send ALL winners' complete data in a single message
# Each winner includes full card numbers and winning pattern
# ==================== FIXED: ALL winners receive complete winner data (not just final winner) ====================
# ==================== INSTANT FAKE PLAYER CARD UPDATES ====================
# Added fake_card_indices to fake_users_added and early_state_update broadcasts
# Allows frontend to mark cards as sold instantly without grid reload
# ==================== CRITICAL FIX: IMMEDIATE FAKE PLAYER BROADCAST ====================
# Fake players now broadcast IMMEDIATELY at game creation, not at 6-7 seconds
# Removed early broadcast delay to show cards from the very beginning of countdown
# ==================== CRITICAL FIX: ENSURE CARD NUMBERS ALWAYS IN WINNER DATA ====================
# Added _ensure_winner_card_numbers method to guarantee card numbers in all winner broadcasts
# Modified get_winners to validate and fix card numbers when retrieving winners
# Updated process_winner and process_fake_winner to use these fixes
# ==================== ADDED: Force game reset endpoint support ====================
# Added force_game_completion method to properly reset game state
# Added clear_all_game_data method for complete cleanup
# ==================== CRITICAL FIX: DUPLICATE GAME PREVENTION ====================
# Added strict active game checking before creating any new game
# Added database-level checks for existing non-completed games
# Fixed start_new_round_game to reuse existing games instead of creating duplicates
# Fixed _schedule_next_round_after_winner_display to check for existing games first
# ==================== FIXED: PROPER TRANSACTION HANDLING ====================
# Added synchronous transaction context manager for database operations
# Added thread pool executor for running sync DB operations in async context
# Fixed toggle_card_purchase to use transaction methods
# Fixed process_winner to use transaction for payment processing
# Added dedicated transaction methods for purchases, refunds, and commission
# ==================== FIXED: DATABASE SCHEMA COMPATIBILITY ====================
# Fixed _record_complete_game_details to use card_price from games table instead of price column
# Fixed _execute_purchase_transaction to handle missing price column gracefully
# Added fallback for databases without price column in player_cards table
# ==================== SINGLE CONTINUOUS GAME LOOP ====================
# Added continuous game loop that handles entire lifecycle:
# card_purchase → active → winner_display → reset and repeat
# Removed separate monitor tasks for countdowns, winner displays, and game continuity
# All game flow now controlled from a single while loop
# ==================== CRITICAL FIX: TRANSACTIONS.BALANCE_AFTER NOT NULL ERROR ====================
# Fixed _execute_purchase_transaction to update balance BEFORE getting new balance
# Fixed _execute_refund_transaction to update balance BEFORE recording transaction
# Fixed _process_winner_payment_transaction to update balance BEFORE recording transaction
# Fixed _record_transaction to use correct balance_after value
# ==================== OPTIMIZED: CARD PURCHASE PHASE TRANSITION ====================
# Optimized _run_card_purchase_phase to transition immediately after countdown
# Optimized _has_enough_players with single query for faster execution
# Added immediate phase change broadcast
# ==================== FIXED: CARD REFUND FUNCTIONALITY ====================
# Fixed _execute_refund_transaction to properly handle refund logic
# Added proper error handling and transaction management
# Ensured prize pool is correctly updated on refund
# ==================== FIXED: SQLite GREATEST FUNCTION COMPATIBILITY ====================
# Replaced GREATEST with MAX(0, prize_pool - ?) for SQLite compatibility
# ==================== FIXED: STATIC CARD SYSTEM ====================
# Added 400 pre-generated fixed cards that never change between games
# Card index 0-399 always have the same numbers in every game
# Modified _generate_bingo_card_numbers to use static data
# Modified _execute_purchase_transaction to use fixed cards
# Modified _add_initial_fake_users to use fixed cards
# ==================== FIXED: INSTANT GAME TRANSITION ====================
# Fixed _run_card_purchase_phase to transition IMMEDIATELY when countdown hits 0
# Removed any delay in checking players and transitioning
# Added synchronous phase change broadcast without awaiting
# ==================== ADDED: CONFIGURABLE FAKE PLAYER LIMITS ====================
# Added set_fake_player_range method to control min/max fake players from admin panel
# Fake player limits can now be configured dynamically without restart
# ==================== ADDED: PERIODIC STUCK GAME CHECKER ====================
# Added periodic checker that runs every 30 seconds to identify and recover stuck games
# Checks games in card_purchase, active, and winner_display phases
# Automatically refunds players in abandoned games
# Verifies number caller is running for active games
# ==================== FIXED: FAKE WINNER PROCESSING SYNCHRONOUS ====================
# Fake winners now processed synchronously with thread pool to prevent race conditions
# Added _execute_fake_winner_transaction for thread-safe DB operations
# Added _generate_fallback_pattern helper method
# ==================== FIXED: DEDICATED NUMBER CALLER FOR 10 BIRR TIER ====================
# GameManager now uses its own dedicated number caller instance
# Prevents cross-contamination with 20 birr tier
